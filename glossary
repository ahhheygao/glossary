__**Essential Terms for Pekora Fans**__

ぺこらんど (Pekoland)
Pekora's self-proclaimed birthplace kingdom, where she was a princess. Also used as the name of any place Pekora intends to colonize or takeover in a game stream. Usada Kensetsu's amusement theme park in Minecraft also shares this name.

どんちゃん (Don-chan)
The name of the scarf-looking long bunny around Pekora's neck. Yes, it's a living creature. Pekora feeds her pet with the carrots in her hair; Pekora doesn't really eat those carrots herself.

野うさぎ (Nousagi) = "hare" or "wild rabbit"
As opposed to domesticated pet bunnies. Official name of Pekora's fans and viewers.

ぺこもん/ペコモン (Pekomon) :PekomonNousagi: :PekomonNousagiCool: 
Named like a Pokémon. Originally drawn by kuu as a "Ditto (Pokémon)" version of Pekora. Adopted by Pekora and her fanbase as mascot and visual representation of Nousagi.

野うさぎ同盟 (nousagi doumei) = Nousagi Alliance
Official name of Pekora's fanbase.

​兎田ファミリア/兎田ふぁみりあ (Pekora Familia) = Pekora's membership
DanMachi reference... or a mafia. Very rarely used nowadays.

スナック兎田 (Snack Usada)
"Snack" in JP refers to a "snack bar restaurant." Pekora-mama plays the role of the kind motherly bartender hostess who offers consultation and life advice to wary Nousagis' questions, troubles, insecurities, etc.

ぺこらママ (Pekora-mama)
〇〇ママ is how JPs traditionally refer to snack bar hostess/bartender. See: Yakuza (龍が如く) game streams.
Pekora-mama is how Pekora herself and Nousagis refer to Pekora during Snack Usada streams. Not to be confused with Pekora's biological mother (mommy) or her design artist (Hagure-mama).
.
__**General Hololive or VTuber Terms**__

ホロメン (HoloMem) = Hololive Members
This is commonly how fans and Hololive VTubers alike refer to other Hololive VTubers. By default it means HoloJP members, but depending on the context, it can also include HoloID and HoloEN as well. Usually implicitly doesn't include HoloStars.

リスナー (listener) = viewer
"Listener" is a catch-all JP loanword term for audience and viewers.

初見さん (shouken-san) = new first-time viewer

海外ニキ (kaigai-niki) = oversea bros
Casual term for oversea viewers outside of Japan. Note that this term's PoV is JP, so ID and EN viewers are still considered "overseas" even when talking about HoloID and HoloEN.

配信 (haishin) = stream/streaming
Short for ライブ配信 (live streaming). This is how HoloMems refer to "streams" most of the time. Often mistranslated as "delivery" by MTLs.

放送 (housou) = broadcasting/streaming
This is a synonym, but it's not used as often by HoloMems. This term is still mostly used by normal streamers.
生放送 (nama-housou) = live broadcast/stream (生 means "raw" in this context)

実況 (jikkyou) = live commentary
Another synonym for live streaming. This term was used more for Let's Play streams.

枠 (waku) = stream (frame)
How JPs refer to the stream video webpage (such as on YouTube). Anything added in front of this describes the nature of the stream. 
Example: 歌枠 (uta waku) means singing stream.

ライブ (live) = concert/stage performance
Note that as a JP loanword in this context, "live" doesn't actually denote *live* performance. "Live" (live concert) just means stage concert.
Think of it as how Americans abbreviated "gasoline" into "gas" even though everyone knows gasoline is fluid, not gas.

リアタイ (riatai) = real-time/live
Abbreviation of "リアルタイム (real time)" This is the JP loanword that actually denotes watching something "live."

MTG = meeting (typically work-related)

ディスコ鯖 = Discord server
.
コラボ (collab) = collaboration

スパチャ (SupaCha) = Super Chat, SC

サムネ (samune) = stream's thumbnail (サムネイル)

メン限 (mem-gen) = member-only

​二回行動 (​nikai koudou) = double movement
Two streams in one day. Gaming reference of special ability to act twice in 1 turn in turn-based games.

案件 (anken) = sponsorship/sponsored
Examples: Crash Bandicoot 4, Curry Meshi, Molly Online

企画 (kikaku) = planned (major) event
Examples: Mario Kart tourney, Minecraft sports fes

雑談 (zatsudan) = free talk stream
VTubers either talk about set of topics, whatever comes to mind, or goes along with live chat's flow of conversation. Pekora rarely does this type of dedicated talk stream but instead does her free talk during low-intensity games like Minecraft or RPG.

作業 (sagyou) = work stream
VTubers focus on whatever menial/repetitive task they're working on instead of actively entertaining the audience and interacting with live chat

同時視聴 (douji shichou) = watch-along stream
Usually mem-only for Pekora

凸待ち (totsumachi) = 凸 (totsu) = "call-in" stream
VTuber waits while fellow VTubers show up call-in voice chat. Pekora refuses to do this stream format due to paranoia fear of rejection that all her friends (except Miko) would troll her for laughs and purposely not show up, thus leaving Pekora all alone as if she has no friends.

逆凸 (gyaku-totsu) = reverse totsu
VTuber calls others instead of waiting for calls.

〇〇位以下 = challenge stream format where VTuber has to end stream if placed [x]th place or lower
Example:
7位以下 - Pekora has to end stream right away if she gets 7th place or lower during Mario Kart

RTA (Real Time Attack) = "speedrun" stream
Except when it comes to Pekora, this has just as much chance to turn into an endurance stream.
This term can also be jokingly as banter to describe any activity that ends faster than usual.
Example:
Toilet RTA (restroom speedrun)
"Stream" speedrun (like the [x]th place or below format, if Pekora loses shortly after stream starts)
.
キャラ (chara) = character; persona

アイドル (idoru) = idol
Pekora proclaims to be one.

芸人 (geinin) = comedian
Pekora denies being one.

推し (oshi) = ("recommended") favorite [girl/idol]
This used to be an idol fan base term, referring to which favorite girl you'd "recommend the most" to other people to follow/watch. Your oshi is Pekora, right? Right? RIGHT??

箱推し (hako oshi) = boxset recommendation
Instead of having one favorite girl, this type of viewer recommends watching the entire idol group. Everyone is best girl, etc.

誰でも大好き (Daredemo Daisuki = DD) = "likes everyone"
Synonym for boxset in the context of Hololive. These viewers profess to like ALL members of a group and will watch everyone's streams. This used to be a pejorative term in idol fan base because it means that the person doesn't have a "favorite girl," kind of like how sports fans might look down on casual fans who don't have a favorite sports team. But now in VTuber lingo, it's a neutral term (similar to how "weeb" and "simp" in EN have lost most of their original derogatory connotations).
By definition, the difference between DD and boxset is that boxset only stays within Hololive, while a DD may support all VTubers.

ガチ恋 (gachikoi) = hardcore fans ("hardcore love")
Another former idol fanbase term. Refer to seriously dedicated fans who'd go above and beyond the average fan's commitment; these are folks who regularly send obligatory SuperChats even when they're busy and can't watch live, reply/comment/retweet everything, and/or tweet during live stream to help VTuber's hashtags trend on JP Twitter.

ガチ恋距離 (gachikoi kyori) = close-up range ("hardcore love distance")
Zoomed-in or enlarged close-up shot of a VTuber. This a joke term referring to how a close-up shot fosters a sense of proximity to the girl and can effectively charm viewers.
.
__**Hololive-related Minecraft Terms**__

マイクラ (MaiKura) = abbreviation for マインクラフト (Minecraft, MC)
Pekora and most HoloMems usually say "MaiKura" instead of the full "Main Kurafuto."

ホロ鯖 (HoloSaba) = Hololive Server
This is the Hololive Minecraft server running on v1.17. 鯖 (mackerel) is pronounced as "saba" in Japanese, so Japanese gamers commonly write "鯖 (saba)" instead of writing out "サーバー (server)."

資源鯖 (ShigenSaba) - Resource Server
Used to be reset on a monthly basis.

新資源鯖 (ShigenSaba) - New Resource Server
This 2nd one resets periodically.

ホロ村 (HoloMura) = Hololive Village
This refers to the flattened area where most Hololive members built their houses. Downtown area.

兎田建設 (Usada Kensetsu = うさ建/兎建 UsaKen) = Usada Construction
The consturction company best known for bringing convenience to HoloMems and advancing HoloMura to the modern age via automation. Safety is secondary.
UsaKen originated in 2019 on Old HoloSaba back when Pekora built rail lines and zombie trap towers, but it didn't become widely recognized by fellow HoloMems until Pekora built TTT on the current HoloSaba (initially to farm gunpowder as fuel for her TNT Cannon). UsaKen was a solo "company-in-name-only" until Pekora ~~headhunted~~ recruited Moona to join her company in 2020.

TTT (Tenkyuu Trap Tower) = Sky Trap Tower
Usada Kensetsu's most iconic facility; the monster trap tower for experience and gunpowder, bow, arrow, bones, etc. for materials that Pekora built back in Nov 2019.
TTT is located within HoloSaba (not resource server), but it's so far away from HoloMura (in order to avoid lagging the server) that it requires using Nether Portals to shrink the distance.
A portal has been implemented in 2021 by HoloSaba admin that allows instant access to TTT area without going through Nether Portals.

全ロス (zen loss) = lose everything (in inventory)
Die in lava/abyss, forgot/don't know where one died, or items too dangerous/far away from last spawn point to recover. Miko's specialty gag.
.
__**Pekora Meta/Fanbase Terms**__

ぺこら先輩 (Pekora-senpai) = upperclassmen/senior
A HoloMem who debuted at an earlier date or from an earlier generation, regardless of the streamer's actual offline age. In JP culture it's generally important to show respect to those who came before you... even if the time gap isn't that wide or seemingly insignificant. As such, Pekora pays respect to any HoloMem prior to 3rd gen by calling them "[name]-senpai." Pekora calls Miko "Miko-senpai" even though Pekora treats her like a peer and shows no reverence.

後輩 (kouhai) = underclassmen
Opposite of the above, but a senpai almost never says "[name]-kouhai" to underclassmen.

三期生の絆 (sankisei no kizuna) = the bonds between 3rd generation members
3rd gen's friendships are famous within Hololive and well-proven. They've met as a group in off-collabs and have fairly high on-stream collabs/interactions within the group. 3rd gen members have a (loose) long-standing agreement to avoid starting streams at the same timeslots. Because of this, they also have a tendency to secretly drop in or watch each others' streams from time to time. At least prior to 2020, Pekora was nominally the leader of the group on-stream, while Marine has been the glue member, mood maker, and the de facto group leader during off-collabs.

ぺこら (Pekora)
Usually how fellow 3rd gen peers as well as several senpais refer to Pekora.

ぺこーら (Pe-ko-ra)
How Pekora refers to herself most of the time.

うーぺー  = う～ぺ～ ("U-Pe-" woo-pey)
U(sada) Pe(kora) is Pekora's default in-game username.

兎田ァ！ (Usada-!)
How Miko usually refers to Pekora. Flare and Suisei also occasionally used this.
.
長 (Osa) = Boss/chief/leader
How Nousagis respectfully refer to Pekora, especially in the context of her position as leader of the Nousagi Alliance, Usada Familia, or whenever Pekora anoints herself as a leader of a group during game streams, such as Dodo Team from ARK, Pekomin from Pikmin, etc. Popularly used by Nousagis in 2020 but not anymore.

ビッグ・ボス (Big Boss)
Pekora's self-picked nickname from her popular and famous (currently privated) Metal Gear streams. This used to be this Discord server's fav nickname for Pekora. Obsolete.

社長 (Shachou) = company president/CEO
How Moona and Nousagis refer to Pekora during Minecraft or anything construction/building related.

ぺこらちゃん (Pekora-chan)
How the majority of the Hololive senpais refer to Pekora. [Name]-chan is a cutesy way of calling someone who's younger or a cute girl.

ぺこちゃん (Peko-chan)
How Nousagis affectionately address Pekora like a cute girl/idol OR patronizingly talking down to the (dumb) bunny as if she were a child. Some "older" or senpai members like Marine or Sora also occasionally use this. Popularly used by Nousagis in 2021; Pekora uses it to refer to herself as well.

ぺこらっちょ (Pekora-cho)
How Korone and Noel refer to Pekora. It's kind of like calling your friend John "Johnny" instead.

うーだーぺこら (U-da- Pekora)
How Pekora reads out her own name as she types out "兎田ぺこら" during poem-writing, because typing "u-sa-da" typically gives different kanji suggestion from JP input. MTL also has similar issue when dealing with "usada."

くさぎ (kusagi) = damn shitty rabbit
くそ (kuso) + うさぎ (usagi) = kusagi

非常食 (hijou shoku) = emergency food supply
During the earlier days of debut, Pekora was treated as emergency food supply by fellow HoloMems on account of her being a rabbit. Threats of boiling and cooking this prankster bunny as punishment for her antics have persisted to this day. 

兎鍋 (usagi nabe) = rabbit stew pot
Miko often threatens to turn Pekora into this dish, along with cooked rabbit meat.
.
__**Pekora Greetings**__

にーんじん、にーんじん (ni~njin, ni~njin) = carrot, carrot

こんぺこ (KonPeko) = "hello peko"
こんにちは (konichiwa = hello, hey there, good day) + ぺこ (peko)

こんぺこ、こんぺこ、こんぺこー！ホロライブ３期生の兎田ぺこらぺこー！どうーも、どうーも！
"Hello, hello, hello~! Hololive 3rd gen's Usada Pekora peko! Nice to meet you, nice to meet you!"

どうも (doumo) = "hello" or "nice to meet you"
The way Pekora strongly emphasizes the "do" and then elongates the "ou" after slight pause lead to the whole Almond, Almond meme.

おつぺこ (OtsuPeko) = "thank you peko" or "good work peko"
お疲れ様 (otsukaresama = good work, thank you) + ぺこ (peko)

〇〇さんっ！ ([name]-san!) = "Mr./Mrs. [name]!"
How Pekora reads the name of SuperChat donors
Nousagis who stay around for the SuperChat donor reading will flood the live chat with さんっ！ to parrot Pekora and show appreciation of Pekora's SuperChat reading. Think of it like waving glowsticks and chanting shouts during her singing performance to show support.
Example: リスナーさんっ！ = "Mr./Mrs. Listener!"

〇〇さんっ！ありぺこっぉ↑ (AriPeko) = "Mr./Mrs. [name! Thank you peko!"
ありがとう (thank you) + ぺこ (peko)
Same as さんっ！ but Pekora did this when she has enough time for longer SuperChat reading. Pekora stopped doing this due to her health condition, scheduling issues, etc.

読み上げおつぺこ (yomiage otsupeko) = Thanks/good job for reading out (the SuperChat messages)

てなわけで、おーつぺーこでーしたー！ばいばーい！エンディング！ = "So, thank you everyone! Bye bye! Ending!"

幸運/こーうん (kou-un) = lucky
こーうん！こーうん！世界で一番かわいいよー！うーぺー！うーぺー！ = "Lucky! Lucky! Cutest in the world! U-Pe-! U-Pe-!"
Chant (aka "call") Okayu came up with during Clubhouse 51 collab stream to tease Pekora with embarrassment, but Nousagis and Pekora liked it so much that Pekora used it herself.

ドドンドドンドンドン！全Vtuber一超絶かわいいのは誰だ！ぺこちゃん！！ = "DoDon DoDon Don Don! Who's the super cutest among all VTubers!? Peko-chan!!"
"New" greeting Pekora introduced during June 11, 2020 stream stream. Direct rip-off from Kanmei in Kingdom manga chapter 310. Unironically quite popular with some HoloMems.
.
__**Pekora-related VTuber Terms and Net Slang**__

プロレス (pro-wres) =  abbreivation of "pro wrestling" (kayfabe or bantering)
Describes VTuber's on-stream ("on stage") interactions/relationships OR roleplay interactions between VTuber and fans.

Example 1: Pekora and Miko beat up each other on-stream, punk each other with pranks, or (jokingly) disparage each other, but Pekora and Miko are good friends off-stream and don't behave that way privately.

Example 2: Nousagis would mercilessly bully and beat up Pekora during Mario Kart or Smash Brothers streams, but when Pekora is asking for assistance during gameplay streams or need translation help, the overwhelming majority of Nousagis give correct answers and sound advice. There are always the occasional pranksters or troublemakers, but those are very small minority or simply want to see Pekora's reaction to a scenario if the game has high death rate anyway and quick respawn. Nousagis don't try to trick Pekora if the wrong decision/move would lead to significant loss of progress or emotional investment in the game.

Example 3: Pekora would often playfully banter with her audience Nousagis and make fun of each other, but when Pekora truly feels down or discouraged, Nousagis would overwhelming support her and shower her with kind words and affection.

営業妨害 (eigyou bougai) = breaking image/reputation ("disrupting business operation")
A purely joke term for "breaking" kayfabe or leaking behind-the-scene info. When a VTuber reveals off-stream or Discord communique that run contrary to another member's on-stream persona/image. For example, if Marine were to share a story about a very helpful or adorably shy Pekora, Pekora might object (out of embarassment) and (jokingly) call out Marine for breaking Pekora's "cultivated image" (of a crazy comedian rabbit).
.
陽キャ (youkya) = positive personality aura, bright person
Often roughly simplified as "extrovert" in translations. Typically associated with friendly and outgoing normies, healthy lifestyles, charismatic people, optimistic attitude.

陰キャ (inkya) = negative personality aura, gloomy person

NOTE: this mostly refers to a HoloMem's off-stream/candid personality, not necessarily their on-stream persona

コミュ障 (komyusho) = communication disorder

Someone who talks tough with bravado or behaves boldly behind a keyboard, but in-person or off-stream they're meek and quiet. Example: Pekora

エゴサ (egosa) = abbreivation of "ego search" (looking up one's own name)
Pekora does this *a lot* on Twitter, searching for any mentions of her own name "ぺこーら" (not just her designated hashtags). Pekora also keeps close eye on self-proclaimed Pekora-loving Nousagi followers to see if they have wandering eyes for other girls.
.
草 (kusa) = www (lol)
笑った/わろた (warota = I laughed) is troublesome to input in JP, so JP net slang uses "w" as abbreviation to denote laughter. "wwwwwwwww" means a lot of laughter and seemingly resembles a lot of grass, so JPs decided to just type 草 (grass) instead.

清楚 (seiso) = wholesome or pure
Example: Pekora

てぇてぇ (TeeTee) = precious
JP net slang mutation of 尊い (toutoi), which was originally used by GL (girls' love) fans to praise the wonderfulness of yuri (similar to "moe" for praising cute anime things). In the context of VTubers, this doesn't only refer to girl-girl romantic undertone coupling; it extents to any friendly, platonic, or sisterly interactions or relationships between VTubers. 

センシティブ (sensitive) = R-18 (adult material)
How JP Twitter refers to R-18 materials. Sensitive usually refers to 18+ visuals/audio/topics. Originally it includes violence, graphic images, controversy, but here it mainly refers to R-18 materials.

えちち/えッッ/​えっっ (Eee) = lewd
Short for エッチ (ecchi = H = pervy, naughty)

アウト/セーフ = safe/out (baseball strikeout)

きｔらあああ (ki-ti-raaaaaaaaaaa) = "Yes!!" "It's here!" or "Finally!" or "Got it!"

Used by Pekora whenever she doesn't remember lyrics of a song OR intentionally doesn't sing the lyrics to avoid copyright issues.

.
〇〇虐 = [person] bullying
Examples: ぺこ虐 for Pekora-bullying, ス虐 for Subaru-bullying

〇〇助かる (tasukaru) = "thanks for [content]" or "[content] is appreciated"

Examples:
天気デッキ - small talk about the weather
ご飯デッキ - small talk about recent meals

〇〇えらい/偉い (erai) = "good job doing [topic]" or "proud of you for [topic]"
This is usually a joke interaction, though sometimes it can be sincere. Usually (but not always) used to praise VTuber for something mundane or expected, like showing up on time or brushing teeth in the morning.
Examples:
起きれてえらい！ - Good job waking up!
謝罪できてえらい！ - Proud of you for properly apologizing!
.
流石/さすが (sasuga) = as expected

解釈一致 (kaishaku itchi) = same interpretation
When JPs agree with ENs' depictions/memes.

けぽ (kepo) = "burp"
Cute way of burping. Because a wholesome cute idol like Pekora can't be heard making vulgar burping noise, right?

Example: Watame's signature look

ちょろい/ちょろ (choroi) = "easily charmed" or "too trusting"

へたくそ (hetakuso) = "[you] suck like crap"
.
フラグ (flag)
フラグ回収 (flag kaishuu) = causation/prophecy fulfilled ("flag recovery")
ENs may refer to this as superstitiously "jinxing [oneself]."
Planting a "flag" is a popular JP term that originated from game programming code for triggers or counters used as prerequisite for events and scripts.
Example:
Side-character: "When this war is over, I'm going to marry my sweetheart back home" triggers a "death flag" that guarantees this character's heart-wrenching death
Pekora: "What would happen if Moona shows up during my tour with Kiara" triggers a flag that guarantees Moona does indeed show up

Reference to "air guitar"
One who never personally played the game but speaks as if one's experienced.
Often backseaters or folks who've watched streams of games but never actually played the games.

ワザップ (Wazzap) = fake tips or outdated/incorrect game intel
Reference to a well-known and notorious JP gamer website (think GameSpot) where users were allowed to freely submit game tips without any verification, which resulted in lots of fake or bad info. Pekora (as well as many HoloMems and JP live chat) will often reference this whenever viewers provide incorrect game tips. For example, giving a legitimate Minecraft Bedrock version tip that doesn't work in Minecraft Java version.
.
姫プ (hime-pu) = abbreviation for "princess play"
When stream snipers purposely go easy or act nice to help VTubers. ENs call this simping.
This JP net slang came from MMORPGs, where male players shower attractive female avatars with gift, gears, assistance, attention, or worship.
Example:
Stream snipers wait for VTuber at the finishing line in Fall Guys so she doesn't get eliminated
Stream snipers purposely don't kill VTuber in Dead by Daylight at the very end

__**Pekora's Biological Family Members**__

ミカエル (Michael/"Mikhail")
Nickname Pekora gave to her oldest brother during June 20, 2020 member-only singing stream, then publicly during the Getting Over It 50-clear endurance stream; further elaborated during the Aug 14, 2019 Snack Usada. By default, Michael is almost always the brother she talks about in childhood stories (stealing his milk, buying her Digimon badge, hanging out in his room, playing his games). More tolerant of her antics when they were kids.

ディアボロ (Diablo)
Nickname Pekora gave to her 2nd older brother during the final stage of Crash 1 and elaborated during Aug 14, 2019 Snack Usada. Pekora isn't close to Diablo and rarely talks about him. Far less tolerant of her antics when they were kids. By her own admission, her ~~spoiled youngest child and bratty only-daughter~~ childhood behavior "probably" contributed to their chilly relationship.

マミー (Mommy; how Pekora refers to her) = ぺこママ  (PekoMama; how fans refer to her) = ~~クリスティーヌ (Christine)~~
Pekora talks about and interacts with her mommy the most.
Debut on-stream in the legendary "coming out" stream on Dec 13, 2020. Pekora has a very familiar, friendly casual relationship with her mom. Mommy spoke with a calm and graceful voice (which Pekora insists is NOT how she normally talks) while also displaying a strong sense of humor by bantering with her daughter in front of over 120k live audience. Ever since, Mommy is the only family who knows about Pekora's VTuber identity and watches her streams.
Fond of alcohol. Blood-type B, like Pekora.
Pekora arbitrarily named her Christine in a tweet on Jun 21, 2019. Not used on-stream.

パピー/パパ (Pappy/Papa) 
Pekora has mentioned her father's existence more than once but doesn't elaborate often. Liked to watch baseball. Blood-type A.

ぺこばあ (PekoObaa)
Pekora's grandma. Still alive, but haven't met or called in a while. Lives in rural area. Ran a candy/general store when Pekora was a kid.
